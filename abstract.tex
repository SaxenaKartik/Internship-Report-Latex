{\normalsize Mechanical Chef is a mechanical and electronic marvel that can cook any Indian cuisine replicating the divine taste of Indian homemade food. It translates an algorithm of encoded steps for a recipe into mechanical movements and prepares the dish with utmost precision. \\[0.1in]
This project aims to build a back-end server, database design and basic user interface for the new Mechanical Chef website to control and monitor the mechanical chef. The website provides a functionality to register a new user, place orders on the mechanical chef, register a new robot, view the real time updates on each step of the recipe and get live video stream on the recipe being cooked. \\[0.1in]
This website encapsulates the overall user experience and automates the whole procedure from loading vegetables and spices in the dispensers to finishing a complete dish}
